# Intro to JavaScript
----

This is my first project on Github.

The following is a simple webpage with its most basic components- a html, css and js file.

This webpage displays a canvas with a circle drawn in it.

html:
---
the html file contains a single canvas tag and an src tag for js file

css:
---
the css file contains a style for the canvas

js:
---
the js file contains two variables- canvas and ctx

the ctx is used to draw on our canvas. Here our canvas is set to 2d(2 Dimensions)

using our ctx, a function is written and called to draw the circle
